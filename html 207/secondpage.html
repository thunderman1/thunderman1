<p><b>HTML LINKS:</b>
One defining feature of HTML document is the ability to move from webpage to another using links. HTML links are hyperlinks. Hyperlinks are specially formatted webpage objects (text or image) that a user can click to jump to (open) another document either on the same webpage or other websites. The world wide web got it spidery name from the plentiful connections (links) that link websites together with the click of a button. The use of hyperlinks make creation of extensive documents easier where section or topics can be quickly accessed through links.
Anchor Element
The HTML anchor <a> element is used to create a link or hyperlink reference (href) to a resource such as another web page, a file, a multimedia element, and so on or to a specific place within a web page. Each hyperlink begins with an <a> tag and ends with an </a> tag. The opening and closing tags surround the text to click to perform hyperlink. The anchor tag requires some attribute and value to work.</P>

<b>Hypertext Reference(href):</b>
The beginning anchor tag takes a very important attribute called the HREF (Hypertext Reference). The href attribute defines reference that the link refers to. It specifies the destination address. This is where the user will be taken if they wish to click this link. Hypertext references can be Internal, Local, or Global.
<h2><p align='center'><b>ANCHOR TEXT AND URL REFERENCE</b></p></h2>
Hyperlink hass two different parts.First,there is the part that is seen on the webpage which is the anchor text.There is also the url reference which tells the browser what to do when the anchor text is clicked.A link's anchor can be a word,or picture.
<p>There are only two types of anchors:text and graphical.The other part of a link is the URL reference.
This is the address of the webpage the browser loads if you click the link.Every  type of link,whether it uses a text or graphical anchor, uses either a relative or absolute reference.</p>
<ol type='a'>
<li><b>Relative References:</b></li>
<p>URL reference to file on the same computer is also known as a relative reference.That means that the URL is relative to the computer and directory from which the browser originally loaded the web page.</p>

<li><b>Absolute Reference</b></li>
<p> A URL reference that specifies the exact computer,directory and file for a web page is an absolute reference.</p>
